# Lo Que No Dije (What I didn't Say)
A bilingual website that showcases my favorite Spanish-language songs through interactive visuals, lyric translations, and personal reflections. Growing up in a predominantly Hispanic community, music became a powerful way for me to connect with culture and identity. This website invites others to experience that connection â€” one song at a time.
